# Open Source Map Made With Leaflet, Vuetify, and Firebase

The original form of this project was created for tracking and displaying locales in Miami's startup scene at http://navigate.miami/

This project has been made with the intent to be project agnostic and more easily reusable.

If you have any questions, please open an issue. Thanks!
